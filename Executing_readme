INITIAL Result:-
Well, i used WEKA's Clustering(Simple UI, almost no coding) at first:
Accuracy= 55 to 65% 
Conclusion= Not Satisfactory(Since not good enough i haven't uploaded any result from it)

Improved Results:-

I found OpenCV's implementation of OCR of Hand-written Data using kNN

Result: accuracy of 93.22%
